	*	LISTEN_IP			Contains the IP of the server

	*	LISTEN_PORT		Contains the port where the server should accept connexion

		ROOT_DIR			The root directory of the server. If not set the root
									directory will be the current directory.

	GET request can only be done on regular files.

	./configure
	make
